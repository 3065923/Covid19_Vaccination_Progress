Presentation Guidelines


You are free to structure your presentations to your liking, but students tend to have success with the following format.


Title Slide

Include the name of the Project and Group Members



Motivation & Summary Slide

Define the core message (hypothesis) of your project.
-Core Hypothesis: We susupect to find  significant correlation between the rate of successful vaccination and other measures of national wellbeing.

Describe the questions you asked, and why you asked them
-What is the relationship between fully vaccinated people and GDP
    -Breaking down by quartile ranges 
-What is the relationship between fully vaccinated people and population density
-What is the relationship between fully vaccinated people and private health expenditure (% that comes from private)

Describe whether you were able to answer these questions to your satisfaction, and briefly summarize your findings
- We were able to confirm that there was a relationship between these factors, however, we also found that the correlation between these factors and vaccination success was far less significant than had surmised.


Questions & Data

Elaborate on the questions you asked, describing what kinds of data you needed to answer them, and where you found it
- Sources: World Bank API & Our World and Data Repository (Vaccination csv file)
- We needed data on vaccination rates globally----> fully vaccinated to ensure "success"
- Needed data on national measures of wellbeing (ie GDP)



Data Cleanup & Exploration

Describe the exploration and cleanup process
- Pulled in csv and grouped by iso code to observe vacciantion totals and # of people fully vaccinated per hundred
- created a df with csv data and added columns with GDP and other wellbeing factors
- We created a nested loop to pull data from the World Bank API for each iso code and the designated variable we were searching
- We dropped any country that was missing any significant datapoints
- converted new collected/clean df into a csv


Discuss insights you had while exploring the data that you didn't anticipate
- Some countries were significant outliers (ex: Gibraltar is 98% vaccinated!!!)


Discuss any problems that arose after exploring the data, and how you resolved them
- Finding data for recent years was difficult. We ultimately decided to pull from 2018 to ensure more variable data was accessible.
    -We decided that this data was still significant as these factors don't change at a fast enough rate to dramatically skew the result
- World Bank (and other sources) do not have data updated in recent years for these data points. Likely done on a decennial rate.
    -couldn't look at factors such as poverty, education, etc...
   


Present and discuss interesting figures developed during exploration, ideally with the help of Jupyter Notebook



Data Analysis

Discuss the steps you took to analyze the data and answer each question you asked in your proposal
Present and discuss interesting figures developed during analysis, ideally with the help of Jupyter Notebook



Discussion

Discuss your findings. Did you find what you expected to find? If not, why not? What inferences or general conclusions can you draw from your analysis?



Post Mortem

Discuss any difficulties that arose, and how you dealt with them
Discuss any additional questions that came up, but which you didn't have time to answer: What would you research next, if you had two more weeks?



Questions

Open-floor Q&A with the audience
